this was a hobby project for me and my boyfriend for a rather extended period of time, and it's extremely flawed and slow and weak, but it was the first big project we had made.
it includes a multitude of 2D gamedev tools, but most of the structures in place are baseline engine things, and have tons of missing features and or are completely dysfunctional.
